Welcome! This repository is dedicated to experimenting with various datasets and machine learning architectures to enhance road safety for both pedestrians and drivers. 
The goal is to evaluate and compare different models to understand how they can contribute to safer road environments.

Purpose
In this project, I am exploring how different machine learning models and architectures perform on a variety of car and road safety-related datasets. 
The purpose of this work is to identify datasets and model approaches that show promise in contributing to safer road systems.

About the Repository
1.Youâ€™ll find multiple datasets here, each relevant to road safety and vehicle interaction.
2.The repository may include models with low initial accuracy or performance as part of early-stage testing. This is an intentional part of the exploration and refinement process.
3.As I continue to gather higher-quality datasets, the repository will evolve, showcasing improvements in model performance and insights into the effectiveness of each approach.

Future Goals
This repository is a growing resource aimed at building knowledge and collecting valuable data for further model development. 
I aim to create models that can be easily adapted and applied to real-world road safety challenges.
